    <h1>Trip Flow Documentation</h1>

    <section id="trip-request">
        <h2>1. Trip Request</h2>
        <p>The trip flow begins when a rider requests a new trip.</p>
        <h3>API Endpoint</h3>
        <p><code>POST /api/trips/rider/request</code></p>
        <p>This endpoint is called by the rider's application to initiate a trip request. It includes details such as pickup and drop-off locations, trip type, and payment method.</p>
        <h3>Backend Event</h3>
        <p><code>TripCreated</code></p>
        <p>When a trip is successfully requested, a <code>TripCreated</code> event is dispatched. This event triggers the driver search process.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="driver-search">
        <h2>2. Driver Search & Assignment</h2>
        <p>After a trip is requested, the system searches for available drivers.</p>
        <h3>Driver Search Logic</h3>
        <p>The driver search logic is handled by the <code>TripService</code>. It identifies nearby drivers who are available and dispatches the trip request to them.</p>
        <h3>API Endpoint</h3>
        <p><code>POST /api/trips/driver/{id}/accept</code></p>
        <p>Drivers accept a trip request by calling this endpoint. The first driver to accept is assigned the trip.</p>
        <h3>Backend Event</h3>
        <p><code>DriverAssigned</code></p>
        <p>Once a driver is assigned to the trip, a <code>DriverAssigned</code> event is dispatched to notify the rider.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="driver-en-route">
        <h2>3. Driver En Route</h2>
        <p>The driver is now on the way to the pickup location.</p>
        <h3>API Endpoint</h3>
        <p><code>POST /api/trips/driver/{id}/location</code></p>
        <p>The driver's application periodically sends location updates to this endpoint.</p>
        <h3>Backend Event</h3>
        <p><code>DriverEnRouteToPickup</code></p>
        <p>This event is dispatched when the driver begins moving toward the pickup location, allowing the rider to track the driver's progress.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="driver-arrival">
        <h2>4. Driver Arrival</h2>
        <p>The driver has arrived at the pickup location.</p>
        <h3>API Endpoint</h3>
        <p><code>POST /api/trips/driver/{id}/arrive</code></p>
        <p>The driver's application calls this endpoint to notify the system that they have arrived at the pickup point.</p>
        <h3>Backend Event</h3>
        <p><code>DriverArrived</code></p>
        <p>This event is dispatched to notify the rider that their driver has arrived.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="trip-start">
        <h2>5. Trip Start</h2>
        <p>The rider is in the car, and the trip begins.</p>
        <h3>API Endpoint</h3>
        <p><code>POST /api/trips/driver/{id}/start</code></p>
        <p>The driver's application calls this endpoint to start the trip.</p>
        <h3>Backend Event</h3>
        <p><code>TripStarted</code></p>
        <p>This event is dispatched to signal that the trip is officially underway.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="location-completion">
        <h2>6. Location Completion (for Multi-Stop Trips)</h2>
        <p>For trips with multiple stops, this phase marks the completion of an intermediate stop.</p>
        <h3>API Endpoint</h3>
        <p><code>POST /api/trips/driver/{id}/complete-location</code></p>
        <p>The driver's application calls this endpoint when they arrive at one of the intermediate locations.</p>
        <h3>Backend Event</h3>
        <p><code>TripLocationCompleted</code></p>
        <p>This event is dispatched to notify the system that a stop has been completed, and the trip can proceed to the next destination.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="trip-completion">
        <h2>7. Trip Completion</h2>
        <p>The trip has reached its final destination.</p>
        <h3>API Endpoint</h3>
        <p><code>POST /api/trips/driver/{id}/complete</code></p>

        <h3>Backend Event</h3>

        <p>A trip can be canceled by either the rider or the driver at different stages of the trip.</p>
        <h3>Rider Cancellation</h3>
        <p><code>POST /api/trips/rider/cancel</code></p>
        <p>A rider can cancel the trip before it starts. Depending on the timing, a cancellation fee may apply.</p>
        <h3>Driver Cancellation</h3>
        <p><code>POST /api/trips/driver/cancel</code></p>
        <p>A driver can cancel the trip, for instance, if the rider does not show up at the pickup location.</p>
        <h3>Backend Events</h3>
        <p>Corresponding events are dispatched for rider and driver cancellations to handle the state change and any applicable fees.</p>
